## Environment Setup

To create and activate a Python virtual environment for this project:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment and register it with Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
````

Activate your environment:

```bash
# Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```

---

## Dependencies

All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate `requirements.txt` after installing packages:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## Data Source

The dataset is downloaded using the `requests` package from:

```bash
https://files.consumerfinance.gov/ccdb/complaints.csv.zip
```

---

## Data Preprocessing

1. Unnecessary columns and results are dropped.
2. A sample of 20,000 rows is taken to ensure smooth processing on laptops with 8â€“16 GB RAM.
3. Text cleaning is performed: removing punctuations, converting to lowercase, etc.
4. Vectorization of text data for machine learning.

## Handling Class Imbalance

* SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to equalize all category sizes.
